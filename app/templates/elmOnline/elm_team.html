                                    Born and raised in China, but living and working in the UK since the late 1980’s, Jian Wang (James) has developed his understanding of both Chinese and Western business culture during his professional career. Together with Alice Childs, he established his advisory business, Elm Lane International Holdings (E.L.I.Holdings), in 1995 to provide investment, trading and government relations advice in China.

E.L.I.Holdings was the first foreign investment advisory company in south-west China and remains the oldest “western” firm still operating there. Not only has James contributed to the growth of business between China and the UK, he has also contributed greatly to China-UK cultural exchange. In 1999, he established the Sichuan Centre in the UK, which has become a “window” into western China and has received official as well as social recognition. The efforts of the Sichuan Centre have been highly praised by both Mr. Hu Jintao (former Paramount Leader of the People’s Republic of China) and Mr. Tony Blair (former UK Prime Minister). During his career, James has participated in over 250 cross-border M&A projects and has served many reputable organisations, including Lornamead, Scottish & Newcastle, Geely Group, Inver House Distillers, Potterton Myson, Freightliner and Sichuan’s Tongwei Group. In 2010 James was instrumental in assisting the Geely Group in its acquisition of the Volvo Car Group from Ford Motor Company in a US$1.8 billion buyout. James was a founding member of the British Chamber of Commerce of Southwest China and served as its first Vice-Chairman, he also has served as Vice-Chairman of the Sichuan Chamber of Commerce and is a member of the Sichuan People’s Standing Committee. In addition, he is a Chengdu Youth Federation Honorary Advisor.

                                    Alice Childs has been creating businesses in China since 1990. She began her “China” education by studying for an undergraduate degree in Chinese and French at Westminster University, graduating in 1988. Her degree studies took her to Sichuan University in 1985/86 and she was later awarded a research scholarship from the British Council to study at Sichuan University in China in 1987/88.

Upon graduation, Alice worked at the Foreign Language Press in Beijing as a foreign expert and editor, translating famous Chinese works of the writer Zhang Xianling and Wang Meng amongst others. In 1989 she served as a personal assistant to the China Manager of Hopkinson Associates, a company that was at that time trading chemicals with many state-owned Enterprises across China. In 1992, she and her husband, James, started Magpie Enterprises, which was to be a precursor to Elm Lane International Holdings (E.L.I.Holdings) which they officially established in 1995. Alice comes from a long line of educators and has continued that tradition by gaining an MSc in Cross-cultural Studies of Child Development at Brunel University, and an MSc in Applied Linguistics & Second Language Aquisition in the Department of Education at Oxford University. She also leads the ELM Education business which focuses on improving the English language skills of Chinese students as well as preparing them for further education in the UK. She served as a Governor of Kelly College (now Mount Kelly) and is currently a Governor of Notting Hill & Ealing High School.
