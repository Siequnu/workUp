# workUp
workUp is a app web application designed to help teachers distribute student work for peer review.

Managing student work for peer distribution is time consuming and can be a large impediment to
teachers implementing this otherwise very beneficial study method. It is hoped that this app can
assist lecturers in implementing peer-review in their classes.

## Literature Review

Despite the overwhelming research in support of peer review as an educational tool (Liu, Psyarchik & Taylor, 2002; Brammer & Rees, 2007; Graff, 2009)
it remains to be implemented in many classrooms. One cause of this is time constraints, and the inherently time consuming nature of peer-review (Crowe, Silva & Ceresola, 2015).

One solution to this is the use of peer-review software to automate administrative tasks inherent to peer review. While [comparative studies](https://www.reap.ac.uk/PEER/Software.aspx) have
been made, most software for this purpose is expensive, and suitable only for large-scale deployment at a University- or College- level. Sofwares like **Aropa**, **Calibrated Peer Review**,
**PeerMark (TURNITIN)**, and **PRAZE** are hard to set-up, resource-intensive to run and require a large amount of commitment and computer knowledge from education practitioners.

workUp is an attempt to make a software that:

* provides simple deployment that can be achieved by any university lecturer,

* provides a clear and easy to use student- and admin-facing interface.

## How It Works

The site works as a simple upload interface, whereby uploaded works are automatically
redistributed amongst the uploadees.

Uploaded files are tagged with a student number, so that the student never receives
their own work back.

Students can log-in to view their assignments, and once an assignment has been upload, the student
can submit peer reviews for two other assignments. These peer reviews are guided through a feedback form,
although as students get more comfortable in providing feedback, progressively less guided forms can be
given to students.

## Deployment

* This git can be cloned onto a deployment server. A suggested location is `/var/www/`.
```sh
$ cd /var/www
$ git clone https://github.com/Siequnu/workUp.git
```

* `config.py.sample` should be cp to `config.py` and the administration sign-up codes filled in.

* Install and enable mod_wsgi:
```sh
$ sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-wsgi python-dev
$ sudo a2enmod wsgi 
```

* a workUp.wsgi file should be created in `/PATH_TO_WORKUP_ROOT/workUp`. Adjust the **PATH_WORK_WORKUP_ROOT** variable in `sys.path.insert`
and add a secret `application.secret_key`.

```sh
#!/usr/bin/python
import sys
import logging
logging.basicConfig(stream=sys.stderr)
sys.path.insert(0,"/PATH_TO_WORKUP_ROOT/workUp/")

from app import workUpApp as application
application.secret_key = *************
```

* in `/etc/apache2/sites-available` create a file called `workUp.conf` based on the template below. Customise the
**SERVER_WEB_NAME**, **SERVER_ADMIN_EMAIL**, **PATH_TO_WORKUP_ROOT**, **SERVER_NAME**,
 and **SERVER_NAME** variables. Leave **SERVER_NAME** and **REQUEST_URI** unmodified in
 `RewriteCond` and `RewriteRule`

```sh
<VirtualHost *:80>
                ServerName SERVER_WEB_NAME
                ServerAdmin SERVER_ADMIN_EMAIL
                WSGIScriptAlias / /PATH_TO_WORKUP_ROOT/workUp/workUp.wsgi
                <Directory /PATH_TO_WORKUP_ROOT/workUp/app/>
                        Order allow,deny
                        Allow from all
                </Directory>
                Alias /static /PATH_TO_WORKUP_ROOT/app/static
                <Directory /PATH_TO_WORKUP_ROOT/app/static/>
                        Order allow,deny
                        Allow from all
                </Directory>
                ErrorLog /PATH_TO_WORKUP_ROOT/logs/error.log
                LogLevel warn
                CustomLog /PATH_TO_WORKUP_ROOT/logs/access.log combined
RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{SERVER_NAME} = SERVER_WEB_NAME
RewriteRule ^ https://%{SERVER_NAME}%{REQUEST_URI} [END,NE,R=permanent]
</VirtualHost>
```

* Enable the virtual host with the following command:

```sh
$ sudo a2ensite workUp
```

* SSL certification can be obtained for free using the [Certbot ACME client](https://certbot.eff.org)

* pip is used to install Flask. If pip is not installed, install it on Ubuntu through apt-get.
This can be installed globally rather than in a virtualenv to facilitate setup.
Install the complete requirements list from requirements.txt

```sh
$ sudo apt-get install python-pip 
$ sudo pip install Flask 
$ pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt
```

* The initial database should be generated by using `flask db init`, `flask db migrate` and finally `flask db commit` to generate tables from the `models.py` page.

* After set-up, restart Apache using `sudo service apache2 restart`

## Deployment notes

* If using **libapache2-mod-wsgi** (`wsgi_mod`) with apache ensure that **WSGIPassAuthorization** is set to `On` in the `.htaccess` file

* Setup server specific config in `config.py`

* Ensure `/static/uploads/` folder is readable by apache:

```sh
$ sudo chown -R www-data static/uploads
```


## Dependencies

The following third-party libraries are used:

`Flask`: common package to write Python web apps;

`flask_httpauth`: authentication handler

`flask-wtf`: handling web forms

`flask-login`: log-in and session manager

`flask-sqlalchemy`: database backend

`flask-migrate`: update databases on deployment servers

`flask-bootstrap`: css theme

`flask-sslify`: maintain and force secure connections

## Deployment notes

There is a bug in the **Flask-wtf** library, whereby Flask wtf form radio-button labels do not render.

This issue is discussed at length [on Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27705968/flask-wtform-radiofield-label-does-not-render)


>It might be intended by the author of "quick_form" macro, or more likely he/she missed a
>line of code to render out the label of RadioField, as the same is done for other types of fields.

The proposed solution is:

> To hack it, locate the file `bootstrap/wtf.html`, where macro `quick_form` is defined.
> Add this line:

```sh
{{field.label(class="control-label")|safe}}

before the "for" loop:

{% for item in field -%}
  <div class="radio">
    <label>
      {{item|safe}} {{item.label.text|safe}}
    </label>
  </div>
{% endfor %}
```

## Usage screenshots
* The student home page allows for quick access to vital information.

![View assignments](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Siequnu/workUp/master/assets/student_home.png)

* Teachers can create assignments targeted at one or more classes. All the uploads for this assignment will be distributed randomly among colleagues for peer-review.

![Create assignment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Siequnu/workUp/master/assets/create_assignment.png)

* Students can quickly check their assignments. Peer reviews can only be uploaded once the student has completed their own assignment.

![View assignments](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Siequnu/workUp/master/assets/view_assignments.png)

* Students can check how many of their colleagues have downloaded their work and submitted peer reviews.

![File Stats](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Siequnu/workUp/master/assets/file_stats.png)

* Teachers can create forms to guide the students through a peer review process. As the students get more comfortable with the peer review process, the teacher can edit the form
to allow the students more freedom with the structure of their peer review.
