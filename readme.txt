workUp is a app web application designed to help teachers distribute student work for peer review.

The site works as a simple upload interface, whereby uploaded works are automatically redistributed amongst the uploadees.

Uploaded files are tagged with a student number, so that the student never receives their own work back.

Future plans are:
	- Develop a database system to track files
	- Student log-in feature where they can access information on their uploads
	- Log to track which files were delivered for peer review to which students

workUp has the following dependencies:
-python >= 2.7
-pip:
	Flask
	Flask-BasicAuth
